## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and inclusive towards others
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Accepting constructive feedback graciously
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior and may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at [email address or contact method]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences.
